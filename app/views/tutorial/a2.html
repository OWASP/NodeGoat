                    In this attack, an attacker (who can be anonymous external attacker, a user with own account who may attempt to steal accounts from others, or an insider wanting to disguise his or her actions) uses leaks or flaws in the authentication or session management
                    functions (e.g., exposed accounts, passwords, session IDs) to impersonate other users. Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords,
                    keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developers frequently build custom authentication and session management schemes, but building these correctly is hard. As a result, these custom schemes frequently have flaws in areas such as logout, password management, timeouts, remember me, secret
                    question, account update, etc. Finding such flaws can sometimes be difficult, as each implementation is unique.

                        Session management related security issues can be prevented by taking these measures:
                        <ul>
                            <li>User authentication credentials should be protected when stored using hashing or encryption.</li>
                            <li>Session IDs should not be exposed in the URL (e.g., URL rewriting).</li>
                            <li>Session IDs should timeout. User sessions or authentication tokens are properly invalidated during logout.</li>
                            <li>Session IDs should be recreated after successful login.</li>
                            <li>Passwords, session IDs, and other credentials should not be sent over unencrypted connections.</li>

                        <b>Protecting user credentials</b>
                        <p>The insecure version of the demo app, password gets stored in database in plain text . Here is related code in
                            <code>data/user-dao.js</code>
                            <code>addUser()</code>method:
                            <pre>
// Create user document
var user = {
    userName: userName,
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    password: password //received from request param
};
                        </pre>
                            The secure version of the app handles password storage in a safer way by using one way encryption using salt hashing as below:</p>
                        <pre>
// Generate password hash
var salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync();
var passwordHash = bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt);

// Create user document
var user = {
    userName: userName,
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    password: passwordHash
};
                        </pre>
                        This hash password can not be decrypted, hence more secure. To compare the password when user logs in, the user entered password gets converted to hash and compared with hash in storage.

                        <pre>
if (bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {
    callback(null, user);
} else {
    callback(invalidPasswordError, null);
}
                        </pre>
                        Note: The bcrypt module also provides asynchronous methods for creating and comparing hash.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <b>Session timeout and protecting cookies in transit</b>

                        <p>The insecure version of the demo application does not contain any provision to timeout user session. The session stays active until user explicitly logs out.</p>

                        <p>The insecure version of the demo application does not prevent cookies being accessed in script, making application vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Also cookies are allowed to send on insecure HTTP connection.</p>

                        <p>The secure version of the application fixes these issues using session based timeouts, terminating session when browser closes. Also, sets
                            <code>HTTPOnly</code>HTTP header preventing cookie being accessed in script. The application used HTTPS secure connections, and cookies are configured to be sent only on Secure HTTPS connections by setting
                            <code>Secure</code>flag.
                            <pre>
// Enable session management using express middleware
app.use(express.cookieParser());
app.use(express.session({
    secret: "s3Cur3",
    cookie: {
        httpOnly: true,
        secure: true
    }
}));
                        </pre>
                            When user clicks logout, the session and session cookie is destroyed
                            <pre>
req.session.destroy(function() {
    res.redirect("/");
});
                        </pre>
                            Note: The example code uses
                            <code>MemoryStore</code>to manage session data, which is not designed for production environment, as it will leak memory, and will not scale past a single process. Use database based storage MongoStore or RedisStore for production.
                            Alternatively, sessions can be managed using popular passport module.

                            The demo application doesn't enforce strong password. In routes/session.js
                            <code>validateSignup()</code>method, the regex for password enforcement is simply <pre>var PASS_RE = /^.{1,20}$/;</pre>

                            <pre>var PASS_RE =/^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,18}$/;</pre>

                            Another issue, in routes/session.js, the
                            <code>handleLoginRequest()</code>enumerated whether password was incorrect or user doesn't exist.This information can be valuable to an attacker with brute forcing attempts. This can be easily fixed using a generic error message
                            such as "Invalid username and/or password".
