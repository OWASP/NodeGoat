  "readme": "# grunt-nodemon\n> Run [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) as a grunt task for easy configuration and integration with the rest of your workflow\n\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-nodemon.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-nodemon) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon.png)](https://gemnasium.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon) [![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon)\n## Getting Started\nIf you haven't used grunt before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a gruntfile as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-nodemon --save-dev\n```\n\nThen add this line to your project's `Gruntfile.js` gruntfile:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-nodemon');\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Usage\nThe minimal usage of nodemon runs with no options:\n```js\nnodemon: {\n  dev: {}\n}\n```\nWhen this is run, nodemon will look at the `package.json` file for the `main` property and run its value as a command in node.\n\n### Common Usage\n\nThis config will start a node server located at `server.js` with the `--debug` node argument to allow for debugging and pass the PORT environment variable.\n\n```js\nnodemon: {\n  dev: {\n    options: {\n      file: 'server.js',\n      nodeArgs: ['--debug'],\n      env: {\n        PORT: '8282'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example with all available options\n\n```js\nnodemon: {\n  dev: {\n    options: {\n      file: 'server.js',\n      args: ['dev'],\n      nodeArgs: ['--debug'],\n      ignoredFiles: ['node_modules/**'],\n      watchedExtensions: ['js'],\n      watchedFolders: ['server'],\n      delayTime: 1,\n      legacyWatch: true,\n      env: {\n        PORT: '8181'\n      },\n      cwd: __dirname\n    }\n  },\n  exec: {\n    options: {\n      exec: 'less'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Running nodemon concurrently\n\nA common use case is to run `nodemon` with other tasks concurrently. This can be achieved with the following config, which uses [grunt-concurrent](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-concurrent) to run nodemon, [node-inspector](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-node-inspector), and [watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) in a single terminal tab:\n```js\nconcurrent: {\n  dev: {\n    tasks: ['nodemon', 'node-inspector', 'watch'],\n    options: {\n      logConcurrentOutput: true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### file\nType: `String`\n\nFile that nodemon runs and restarts when changes are detected.\n\n### args\nType: `Array` of `Strings`\n\nList of arguments to be passed to your file.\n\n### nodeArgs\nType: `Array` of `Strings`\n\nList of arguments to be passed to node. The most common argument is `--debug` or `--debug-brk` to start a debugging server.\n\n### ignoredFiles\nType: `Array` of `String globs`\n\nList of ignored files specified by a glob pattern. [Here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#ignoring-files) is an explanation of how to use the patterns to ignore files. This task will create a `.nodemonignore` file in your repo based on these settings which nodemon reads when it starts.\n\n### watchedExtensions\nType: `Array` of `Strings`\n\nList of file extensions to watch for changes. By default, nodemon watches `.js`, `.coffee`, and `.litcoffee` files.\n\n### watchedFolders\nType: `Array` of `Strings` Default: `'.'`\n\nList of folders to watch for changes if you don't want to watch the root folder and its subdirectories.\n\n### delayTime\nType: `Number`\n\nDelay the restart of nodemon by a number of seconds when compiling a large amount of files so that the app doesn't needlessly restart after each file.\n\n### legacyWatch\nType: `Boolean`\n\nIf you wish to force nodemon to start with the legacy watch method. See <https://github.com/remy/nodemon#help-my-changes-arent-being-detected> for more details.\n\n### cwd\nType: `String`\n\nThe current working directory to run your file from.\n\n### env\nType: `Object`\n\nHash of environment variables to pass to your file.\n\n### exec\nType: `String`\n\nYou can use nodemon to execute a command outside of node. Use this option to specify a command as a string with the argument being the file parameter above. You can read more on exec [here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#running-non-node-scripts).\n\n# Changelog\n\n**0.1.1** - Added `legacyWatch` option thanks to [@jonursenbach](https://github.com/jonursenbach).\n\n**0.1.0** - Removed `debug` and `debugBrk` options as they are encapsulated by the `nodeArgs` option.\n\n**Breaking changes:**\n\n- Configs with the `debug` or `debugBrk` options will no longer work as expected. They simply need to be added to `nodeArgs`.\n\n**0.0.10** - Added `nodeArgs` option thanks to [@eugeneiiim](https://github.com/eugeneiiim).\n\n**0.0.9** - Fixed bug when using `cwd` with `ignoredFiles`.\n\n**0.0.8** - Added error logging for incorrectly installed `nodemon`.\n\n**0.0.7** - Added `debugBreak` option thanks to [@bchu](https://github.com/bchu).\n\n**0.0.6** - Added `env` option.\n\n**0.0.5** - Added `cwd` option.\n\n**0.0.4** - Added `nodemon` as a proper dependency.\n\n**0.0.3** - Uses local version of `nodemon` for convenience and versioning.\n\n**0.0.2** - Removes `.nodemonignore` if it was previously generated and then the `ignoredFiles` option is removed.\n\n**0.0.1** - Added warning if `nodemon` isn't installed as a global module.\n\n**0.0.0** - Initial release\n",
